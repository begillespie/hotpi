Environmental data logging and graphing. There are two components to this
project: the Python script and the Couchapp.

== Python script ==
Copy the Python directory to wherever you want to run it from. Set up a CRON
job to run the script every 5 minutes (or more, or less - your choice).

== Couchapp ==
With a running CouchDB installation and Couchapp installed, use the 
'''couchapp push''' command to install.
